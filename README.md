> We present a diffusion-based generative approach that directly outputs a CAD B-rep. BrepGen uses a novel structured latent geometry to encode the CAD geometry and topology. A top-down generation approach is used to denoise the faces, edges, and vertices. 


## Requirements

### Environment (Tested)
- Linux
- Python 3.9
- CUDA 11.8 
- PyTorch 2.2 
- Diffusers 0.27


### Dependencies

Install PyTorch and other dependencies:
```
conda create --name brepgen_env python=3.9 -y
conda activate brepgen_env

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install chamferdist
```

If `chamferdist` fails to install here are a few options to try:

- If there is a CUDA version mismatch error, then try setting the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable to point to CUDA installation folder. The CUDA version of this folder must match with PyTorch's version i.e. 11.8.

- Try [building from source](https://github.com/krrish94/chamferdist?tab=readme-ov-file#building-from-source).

Install OCCWL following the instruction [here](https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/occwl).
If conda is stuck in "Solving environment..." there are two options to try:

- Try using `mamba` as suggested in occwl's README.

- Install pythonOCC: https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core?tab=readme-ov-file#install-with-conda and occwl manually: `pip install git+https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/occwl`.

## Data
Download [ABC](https://archive.nyu.edu/handle/2451/43778) STEP files (100 folders). 

The faces, edges, and vertices need to be extracted from the STEP files.  

Process the B-reps (under ```data_process``` folder):

    sh process.sh


Remove repeated CAD models (under ```data_process``` folder, default is ```6 bit``` ):

    sh deduplicate.sh

You can download the deduplicated files for [DeepCAD](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N_60VCZKYgPviQgP8lwCOVXrzu9Midfe?usp=drive_link), [ABC](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bA90Rz5EcwaUhUrgFbSIpgdJ0aeDjy3v?usp=drive_link) and [Furniture](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jgAvZssPmZZJ8irPJqQwo0wtvQ3K7o89?usp=sharing).



## Training 
Train the surface and edge VAE (wandb for logging):

    sh train_vae.sh

Train the latent diffusion model (change path to previously trained VAEs):

    sh train_ldm.sh

```--cf``` classifier-free training for the Furniture dataset. 

```--data_aug``` randomly rotate the CAD model during training (optional).




## Generation and Evaluation
Randomly generate B-reps from Gaussian noise, both STEP and STL files will be saved:

    python sample.py --mode abc

This will load  the settings in ```eval_config.yaml```. Make sure to update model paths to the correct folder. 

Run this script for evaluation (change the path to generated data folder, with at least 3,000 samples):

    sh eval.sh
    
This computes the JSD, MMD, and COV scores. Please also download sampled point clouds for [test set](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kqxSDkS2gUN9_qpuWotFDhl4t7czbfOc?usp=sharing). 


## Pretrained Checkpoint
We also provide the individual checkpoints trained on different datasets.
